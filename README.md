Before run Framework, sure that you installed ROS (Noetic) and Carla (version >= 0.9.13).

# Initial
Step1: Build ros package 02_RosCommunication -> source to this package (run devel\setup.bat to link packet with terminal)

Step2: In the same terminal, build ros package 01_RosBridge -> source to this package (this source step is important, need do this first at any terminal).

For Carla has different version (not 0.9.13), you must change this in 01_RosBridge/src/carla_ros_bridge/src/carla_ros_bridge/CARLA_VERSION file. Then build again.
